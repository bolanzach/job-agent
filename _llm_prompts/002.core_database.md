# Core Service

Your job is to create a core service for managing entities such as **JobPosts**, **Companies**, **Users**, etc.
You must build out the basic boilerplate code for the service.

Always use best practices and modern Deno/Typescript features.

### JobPosts, Companies, etc

See core/readme.md for more details.

## Database

We need to use a relational SQL database.
This must be pluggable, so we can use SQLite for local development and Postgres for production (to do later on).

**IMPORTANT: For now, we will use SQLite.**

## Server

We will use Typescript and Deno to create a REST API server.

## Entities

```typescript
interface JobPost {
  id: string; // primary key UUID
  url: string; // unique
  companyId: string; // foreign key UUID
  title: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date; // timestamptz
}

interface Company {
  id: string; // primary key UUID
  name: string; // unique
  website: string; // unique
  createdAt: Date; // timestamptz
}
```

## Requirements and Steps:

- Work within the `core/` directory.
- Start with setting up SQLite database with tables for JobPosts and Companies.
- Next, setup a barebones Deno application.
- Install and configure `pgtyped` for type-safe SQL queries.
- Install and configure `tsoa` for REST API generation.
- Create a single REST endpoint to create a Company.
