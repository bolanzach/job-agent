# Job Discovery and Matching Agent

## Project Overview
Personal job search tool that automatically discovers companies based on my preferences (circular economy/sustainability/climate tech) and matches job postings against user profile using LLM evaluation.

## Core Architecture

The project is a monorepo with all components in the single repository.

### Data Storage
- **Key-Value Store**: Company profiles (JSON, deduplicated by company name/website)
- **SQL Database**: Metadata, relevance scores and matches, job information
- **Reverse Index**: Full-text search across job descriptions
- **Object Storage**: Raw job postings (optional)

### Python Web Crawler

- Scrape company websites for job postings
- Find new relevant companies from discovery sources

### Typescript Event-Driven API
```python
POST /sources  # Add discovery sources (VC portfolios, conferences, etc.)
```

Core events:
- `discover_companies` - Find new companies from source
- `crawl_jobs` - Scrape job postings from companies
- `evaluate_relevance` - LLM scoring for company/job relevance
- `match_jobs` - Match jobs against user profile

## Company Discovery Sources
1. **VC Portfolio Pages**: Climate-focused VCs (Bessemer Green, Energy Impact Partners)
2. **Crunchbase API**: Recent funding in sustainability categories
3. **Conference Lists**: Climate tech events, accelerator demo days
4. **GitHub Organizations**: Sustainability/circular-economy tagged repos

## LLM Integration

### Company Evaluation
- Sustainability relevance filter
- Circular economy alignment score (1-10)
- Software engineering hiring potential

### Job Matching
Direct content analysis:
```python
llm.generate(f"""
User profile: {profile}
Job posting: {job_content}
Company info: {company_info}
Rate match 1-10 and explain.
""")
```

## Workflow
1. Add source â†’ trigger discovery
2. Store companies in KV + SQL
3. LLM evaluates company relevance
4. Crawl jobs from relevant companies
5. LLM matches jobs to user profile
6. Surface recommendations via search/filters

## Technical Stack
- REST API with event triggers
- PostgreSQL with full-text search
- Key-value store (Redis/DynamoDB)
- LLM API integration for scoring
- Web scraping for job discovery
