# Python Intelligence Module

This is a uv python module that provides functions to enhance/hydrate our entities using AI and LLMs.
This also includes the mechanisms that match a candidate to a job posting.

Look at the existing project structure in `./crawler`.
You are a senior software engineer. Your job is to create a similar uv pythong module in `./intelligence`

## Overall Structure

```
intelligence/
    ai/             # functions for ai/llm interactions
        main.py
        
    job_posting/    # functions for job posting enhancement
        main.py
        src/
```

Mock out the llm calls for now. Later we will integrate with the actual llm calls (e.g. openai, anthropic, etc.)

The `main.py` files should have the main functions that will be called by other parts of the system.
The main functions should be easily invoked/startup.

Do not make excessive comments. Only comment where necessary.
