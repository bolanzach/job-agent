# Discover Companies scaper

Read _llm_prompts/000.context.md for some context.

Look in the `crawler/company` **uv python** module.

We need to create a new scraper that will discover companies that will potentially have jobs.
The idea is that as we find companies we will add them to our database and then later we will scrape their job postings.
For now, we are only concerned with discovering companies.

## Instructions

I think the best way to do this is to start with a "seed" company and then look for similar companies.

- Start with a seed company (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc). This will be provided as an input to the scraper.
- Use a search engine (e.g. Google, Bing, etc) to find similar companies. You can use search queries like "companies
  similar to {seed_company}".
- Scrape the search results to extract company names and their websites.
- For each company, MOCK and API call to save the company to our database
- This should be recursive. For each new company found, repeat the process to find more companies. We should have a
  depth limit to avoid infinite loops but in practice the depth will be very large.

## Code Style

- Do not add unnecessary comments. The code should be self-explanatory.
- Look at how the existing scraper and script entrypoint work.
- Keep the implementation simple. We don't need to handle every edge case.
