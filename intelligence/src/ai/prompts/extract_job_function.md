## Your Goal:

You must identify the **"job function"** for the below job description.

We identify each job function as a unique category that describes the primary role and responsibilities of the job.
**IMPORTANT**: You must **ONLY** respond with the Job Function.

These are the potential job functions.
You must only select ONE from this list.
The result must be in EXACTLY this format: {job_function_name}

- {software_development}
- {project_management}
- {ux_design}
- {sustainability_management}
- {software_management}
- {data_science}
- {sales}
- {marketing}
- {solutions_architecture}

If the job description does NOT fit into any of the potential job functions then you are allowed to generate a new job
function category.
If the provided job description is not a valid job description, then respond with {none}.
Notice that all job functions follow the format: {job_function_name}.
Responding with anything other than the correctly formatted job function will be considered a failure.

### The job description:

{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}
